## Lyrics

The first time you appeared in my life,
It felt so strange.
A girl with dark hair,
Doing things so out of range.
But I was broken inside, so lost and alone,
I followed you blindly.
Now you’re etched in my soul, how can I forget you?

It’s not easy, no!
Your eyes, your lips, they're all I ever know!
And I can’t stop thinking how it could be,
With you by my side, though it's all fantasy.

A strange divide happened deep in my heart,
From the moment I knew you, everything fell apart.
No longer do I live just to pass the time,
But for the dream of seeing you, making you mine.
How can I forget you? It’s not easy, no.

Your eyes, your lips, they're all I ever know!
And I can’t stop thinking how it could be,
With you by my side, though it's all fantasy.
Though it's all fantasy.
Though it's all fantasy.

## Trivia

- An almost identical version of this song can be found on the internet under the name "All for Asia", the only difference being the different vocals and the fact that it has a "fading out" instead of a "cold ending". It also has an identical cover with a snow peak on a blue background. Apparently, the song was dedicated to a certain Asia Vieira.
