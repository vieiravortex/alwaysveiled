- **Genre:** Action-adventure, Psychological horror

"Always Veiled" is an upcoming indie action-adventure game with psychological horror elements, currently in early development by [*Vieira Vortex*](vieiravortex.md). The project is in the conceptual stage, with developers focusing on core gameplay mechanics, world-building, and narrative structure.

## Concept

The game is designed to feature two distinct gameplay styles, offering players different perspectives on the unfolding events. This duality is reflected both in the narrative approach and the core gameplay mechanics.

One protagonist's gameplay will emphasize psychological horror, atmospheric tension, and investigative elements. This character's sections will be played from a **first-person perspective**, immersing the player in a slow-paced experience with exploration, puzzle-solving, and survival mechanics. The horror elements are inspired by [*F.E.A.R.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R.) (2005), developed by [*Monolith Productions*](https://www.lith.com/), known for its dynamic AI-driven enemy encounters and psychological horror elements.

Additionally, moments of calm, introspection, and emotional depth will take inspiration from [*Silent Hill 2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_2) (2001), developed by [*Konami*](https://www.konami.com/). These sequences aim to provide contrast to the game's more intense horror and action moments, offering a deeper narrative experience.

The second protagonist, in contrast, will engage in fast-paced action sequences from a **third-person perspective**, featuring intense combat, chases, and cinematic set-pieces. This aspect of the gameplay is influenced by titles such as [*Max Payne*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne) (2001), developed by [*Remedy Entertainment*](https://www.remedygames.com/), and [*Uncharted*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted) (2007), developed by [*Naughty Dog*](https://www.naughtydog.com/). Despite its action focus, the game will retain elements of psychological horror, ensuring that the sense of unease persists throughout the experience.

## Features

The developers are considering the following gameplay features:

- **Dual gameplay styles** – players can experience both psychological horror from a first-person perspective and action-packed gameplay from a third-person perspective, depending on the chosen character.
- **Tactical combat mechanics** – inspired by *F.E.A.R.* (2005), featuring dynamic gunplay, intelligent enemy AI, and environmental interactions.
- **1980s setting** – the game aims to capture the aesthetics, technology, and cultural atmosphere of the late 1980s.
- **Psychological horror elements** – horror sequences will use advanced AI and scripted events to create tension, while moments of quiet reflection will be influenced by *Silent Hill 2* (2001).

## Development

"Always Veiled" is currently in the early planning stage. The developers at [*Vieira Vortex*](vieiravortex.md) are exploring different approaches to blending horror and action gameplay. No release date has been announced.
